            <h2>Roast Beef: The Low and Slow Path to Delicious</h2>
            <p>Roast beef dinner truly is a timeless dish. It can be made with rump roast or sirloin roast.
                It is prepared by slow-roasting the meat. This process work wonders by turning an otherwise
                tougher cut of meat into a tender and juicy dinner the family will love.</p>
            <p>It is not a complicated dish to make. With a good piece of meat and some simple herbs it
                becomes more tender and flavorful than anything you can buy at the store. Roast beef goes very well with
                gravy and mashed potatoes. The leftovers are great for sandwiches, too!
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 to 3 1/2 pounds(1.3 to 1.6 kg) boneless rump roast (pick an end cut with a layer 
                    of fat, if you can)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>8-10 slivers garlic (3 to 4 cloves, sliced in half or into thirds)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Salt the roast and let it come to room temp:
                    The beef should be brought as close to room temperature as possible 
                    before you start to roast it, so that it cooks more evenly. Remove it 
                    from the refrigerator at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before cooking. 
                    Open the wrapping, sprinkle all sides with salt, and wrap it up again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 375°F:
                    (190°C). Move a rack to the center of the oven, and place the other one underneath.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Insert slivers of garlic into the roast:
                    Pat the roast dry with paper towels. Use the tip of a sharp knife 
                    to make 8 to 10 small incisions around the roast. Put a sliver of 
                    garlic into each cut.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rub the roast with olive oil, then season:
                    Rub olive oil all over the roast. Sprinkle it all 
                    around with salt and pepper. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put the roast on the rack with a pan below:
                    Place the roast directly on the middle oven rack, fatty side 
                    up, with a roasting pan to catch the drippings on the rack beneath it.
                    Placing the roast directly on the rack like this with a pan on the 
                    rack below creates a convection type environment in the oven, allowing 
                    the hot air to more easily circulate around the roast, so you don't 
                    have to turn the roast as it cooks.
                    Place the roast, fat-side up so that as the fat bathes the entire 
                    roast in flavor as it melts. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brown at 375°F, then lower the heat to 225°F:
                    Cook the roast initially at 375°F (190°C) for half an hour, to brown 
                    it. Then lower the heat to 225°F (107°C). The roast should take 
                    somewhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours more to cook.
                    The shape of the roast will affect the cooking time. If your roast 
                    is long and narrow, rather than a more round shape, it may take less 
                    time to cook, so keep an eye on it. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roast to an internal temp of 135°F to 140°F:
                    When juices start to drip from the roast, and it is browned 
                    on the outside, check the roast's internal temperature with a 
                    meat thermometer. Remove the roast from the oven when the internal 
                    temperature of the roast is 135°F to 140°F (for medium rare meat).
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Make the gravy as the roast rests:
                    Place the roast on a cutting board and tent it with aluminum foil to 
                    keep it warm. Let it rest for 20 to 30 minutes before cutting. (Resting 
                    the cooked roast is important. If you cut into it too soon, the roast 
                    will lose more of its juices.)
                    To make the gravy: Remove the dripping pan from the oven and place on 
                    the stove top at medium heat. Note that if you are pulling the roast 
                    out early, for rare or a medium rare level of doneness, you may not 
                    have a lot of drippings. Hopefully you will have some. If not, you 
                    may want to leave the roast in a little longer at even lower heat, 
                    175°F, to ease some more drippings out of it.
                    Add some water, red wine, or beef stock to the drippings to 
                    deglaze (loosen the drippings from the pan). Dissolve a tablespoon 
                    of cornstarch in a little water and add to the drip pan. Stir 
                    quickly while the gravy thickens to avoid lumping.
                    You can add a little butter if there is not a lot of fat in the 
                    drippings. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mom adds some fresh 
                    thyme too if she has some. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slice and serve:
                    After the roast has had a chance to rest a bit (and reabsorb 
                    its juices), thinly slice the roast to serve. (A sturdy long 
                    bread knife works well for slicing roasts.)   
                    Pour the gravy over the slices or serve on the side.
                </li>
