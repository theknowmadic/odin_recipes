            <h2>Roast Beef: The Low and Slow Path to Delicious</h2>
            <p>Roast beef dinner truly is a timeless dish. It can be made with rump roast or sirloin roast.
                It is prepared by slow-roasting the meat. This process work wonders by turning an otherwise
                tougher cut of meat into a tender and juicy dinner the family will love.</p>
            <p>It is not a complicated dish to make. With a good piece of meat and some simple herbs it
                becomes more tender and flavorful than anything you can buy at the store. Roast beef goes very well with
                gravy and mashed potatoes. The leftovers are great for sandwiches, too!
