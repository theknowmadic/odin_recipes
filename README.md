Introduction

In this project I am demonstrating what I have learned from The Odin Project by creating a basic recipe website.

The skills I will be demonstrating are the following:

- Coding a basic HTML structure:
    - A basic boilerplate
    - Adding a header
    - Making a relative link from one HTML file to another
    - Adding an image to the website with alt attribute
    - Writing two descriptive paragraphs per page
    - Making ordered and unordered lists
    - Adding emphasis to the text by using bold and italic
- Proper folder structure
- Writing proper commit messages
